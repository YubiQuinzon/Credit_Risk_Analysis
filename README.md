# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview

To incorporate different machine learning models to predict credit risk and compare their performances. Our goal, is to see which model is the best predictor in accurately assigning the correct label

## Labels

The labels we are looking at are "low_risk" and "high_risk"
- "low_risk" indicates that there is a high probability/risk that the issued loan will not be paid back
- "high_risk" indicates that the individual has a high probability that they can pay back the loan in full
